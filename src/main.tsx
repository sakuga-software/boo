  States
    approved       CodeRabbit reviewed the last commit, and its last verdict approves
    changes requested
                   CodeRabbit reviewed the last commit, and its last verdict requests changes
    reviewed       CodeRabbit reviewed the last commit, with no verdict: comments only,
                   or a dismissed verdict
    reviewing      the CodeRabbit summary shows a review in progress
    quota          the quota is not back; shows when it comes back
    requested      a bare "@coderabbitai review" of less than 15 min waits for a reply
    nothing to do  the last commit has no review, but no rate limit is active
    to retry       the quota is back: posts a bare "@coderabbitai review"
    skipped        CodeRabbit skipped the review (a bot author, a draft…); r requests one
    paused         automatic reviews are paused and the last commit has no review
    no review yet  CodeRabbit has not commented on the pull request
    merged         the pull request is merged; the tool no longer watches it
    closed         the pull request is closed; the tool no longer watches it
    draft          the pull request is back to draft; watched again if it is ready

  A commit counts as reviewed with a GitHub review on it, or with a finished
  review of it in the CodeRabbit summary. The verdict is the last CodeRabbit
  review that approves, requests changes or is dismissed, as on GitHub.

  The quota belongs to the developer, so the tool reads one clock from all the
  listed pull requests (per repository on the CodeRabbit Open source plan).
  The time comes from the newest notice with a delay ("available in …",
  counted from the last edit of that comment, plus 30 s because CodeRabbit
  rounds its delays), on this pull request or on another one. A refused
  command with no delay only dates the refusal. "N remain after this review"
  on a later review means the quota is back. If a refusal came after the time
  that the newest notice gave, the tool assumes 1 hour. It posts one request
  at a time, and polls for the reply to each one for about 90 s.

  With --watch, the tool searches the pull requests again once a minute. It
  adds the new ones, shows the ones that are merged, closed or back to draft,
  and checks the settled and waiting ones again. A first review then shows up
  when it starts and when it ends, and so does an approval during a quota wait.

  Keys and mouse
    With --watch in a terminal, the list takes keys and mouse clicks:
    ↑ ↓  or  k j    select a pull request; the mouse wheel does it too
    o  or  Enter    open the pull request in the browser
    r               post "@coderabbitai review"
    f               post "@coderabbitai full review"
    a               post "@coderabbitai approve": resolve the threads, then approve
    s               post "@coderabbitai resolve": resolve the threads
    m               merge the pull request (squash, else merge, else rebase)
    h               hide or show the merged, closed and draft pull requests
    q               quit
  Each post and each merge asks for a confirmation: y or Enter confirms, n or
  Esc cancels. Before a merge, the confirmation warns if CodeRabbit has not
  approved the last commit, or if GitHub reports a conflict, failing checks or
  a protection rule. A click selects a row or presses a button. The mouse mode
  takes over text selection: hold Shift or Option, depending on the terminal,
  to select text.
